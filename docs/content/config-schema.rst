Config
======

Config files define a number of parameters for the FDB. 

The following is of the form local:
::
  type: local
  engine: toc
  schema: ./schema
  spaces:
  - hanlder: Default    
    roots:
    -path: /path/to/fdb/root

There a number of different types such as local, remote, distributed, and select.

Local implements the passage of dara from the frontend to storage backend, talk to the FDB Store and Catalogue. 
Depending on the backend, the data or metadata may not actually be local.

Select dispatches requests to different FDB's based on the metadata associated with the Messages, and can be used to send split requests OD from RD.

Select Type:
::
  type: select
  fdbs:
  - select: class=od
    type:local
    spaces:
      roots:
        -path: /path/to/fdb/od
  -select: class=rd,expver=xx.?.?
    type: local
    spaces:
      roots:
        - path: /path/to/fdb/rd

The remote type handles access to the remote FDB vis TCP/IP. It talks to the FDB server using an asynchronous protocol.
It only handles the transition. not the distribution of data.

Remote type:
::
  type: remote
  host: fdb-minus
  port: 36604

The distributed type implements the multi-lane access to multiple FDB's. It uses rendezvous hashing to avoid synchronisations.

Dist type:
::
  type: dist
  lanes:
    -type: remote
      host: fdb-minus-1
      port: 36604
    -type: remote
      host: fdb-minus-2
      port: 36604

These types can be composed together in the config file when using FDB.

## TODO: Get this reviewed and add more information.

Schema
======

The schema indexes structure and dala collocation policy. It is used to uniquely describe the data that is being stored and indexed. 

The schema uses global attributes that describe the underlying data with each attribute having a name and datatype, these are added at the beginning of the file.
::
  param:     Param;
  step:      Step;
  date;      Date;
  latitude;  Double;
  longitude; Double;

The schema then describes rules for accessing all data stored by the fdb.

Each rule is described using three levels. The first level defines the attributes of te top level directory, the second level defines the attributes used to name the data files, and the third level attributes are used as index keys.
Example of a rule:
::
  [ class=ti/s2, expver, stream, date, time, model
    [ origin, type, levtype, hdate?
      [ step, number?, levelist?, param ]]
  ]

Rules can be grouped in the form:
::
  [a1, a2, a3 ...
    b1, b2, b3... [c1, c2, c3...]]
    B1, B2, B3... [C1, C2, C3...]]
  ]

A list of values can be given for an attribute.
::
  [ ..., stream=enfo/efov, ... ]

Attributes in rules can also be optional using the ? character.
::
  [ step, levelist?, param ]

Attributes can be removed using the - character.
::
  [grid-]

Rules are then matched if:
  * the attributes are present or marked optional
  * a list is provided, one of them matched

An example schema is provided schema_.
