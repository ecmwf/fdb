===============================

FDB (Fields DataBase) is a domain-specific object store developed at ECMWF for storing, indexing and retrieving GRIB data. Each GRIB message is stored as a field and indexed trough semantic metadata (i.e. physical variables such as temperature, pressure, ...).
A set of fields can be retrieved specifying a request using a specific language developed for accessing MARS Archive.
