Welcome to FDB's documentation!
===============================

FDB (Fields DataBase) is a domain-specific object store developed at ECMWF for 
storing, indexing and retrieving GRIB data. Each GRIB message is stored as a 
field and indexed trough semantic metadata (i.e. physical variables such as 
temperature, pressure, ...). A set of fields can be retrieved specifying a
request using a specific language developed for accessing MARS Archive.
